GM! Iâ€™m 0xodose. 

A Web3 strategist & business developer with a finance background.

Used to run a boutique fund, now building [xore.io ](https://www.xore.io/) by Exodia Technologies - a Web 3.0 digital contemporary establishment / creative studio. 

I'm getting involved in DeFi & NFT, and would like to build and deploy tech-enabled products on Web3 & Web2 space.
Currently learning how to code and develop Dapps with buildspace.
My goal is to continuously create tech-enabled IPs and expand user base of >1 million, and assume a formal position in DeFi.

I can be reached via Twitter @0xodose or via email 0xodose@gmail.com

Long term value > short term gratification. Build & contribute.
